  <Card title="For Builders" icon="wrench" href="/ecosystem/builder-guide">
    - Verifiable performance through reproducible backtests
    - Production infrastructure for seamless deployment
    - Marketplace monetization with transparent metrics
    - Same code runs from backtest to live trading
  </Card>

  <Card title="For Buyers" icon="wallet" href="/ecosystem/buyer-guide">

    - Transparent performance metrics and risk analytics
    - Deploy strategies without coding knowledge
    - Built-in risk management and monitoring
  </Card>

## Core Platform Values

**Transparency**: All strategy performance is verifiable and reproducible through the ClyptQ Trading Engine.

**Reliability**: Backtest and live trading run on identical infrastructure, ensuring what you test is what you get in production.

**Accessibility**: Builders access production-grade tools, Buyers deploy strategies without technical expertise.

## ClyptQ Trading Engine

The foundation of the Clypt ecosystem is the **ClyptQ Trading Engine**, a production-grade quantitative trading system with four core layers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="System Layer">
    **Execution Infrastructure**

    - ComputeGraph: DAG-based execution with automatic dependency resolution
    - TaggedArray: 4-field data structure (value, exists, valid, updated) for robust data handling
    - Operator Protocol: Standardized interface for all trading operations

    ```python
    graph = ComputeGraph()
    signal = graph.add_node("signal",
        CrossoverAlpha(Input("sma_fast"), Input("sma_slow"))
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Operator Layer">
    **Strategy Composition**

    - 9 Operator roles: ALPHA, FACTOR, FILTER, INDICATOR, METRIC, TRANSFORM, OPTIMIZER, SCORE, SEMANTIC
    - 40+ built-in technical indicators
    - Composable operators for complex strategies

    ```python
    sma_fast = SMA(Input("close", lookback=10), span=10)
    sma_slow = SMA(Input("close", lookback=50), span=50)
    signal = CrossoverAlpha(sma_fast, sma_slow)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Trading Layer">
    **Execution & Risk Management**

    - TradingDriver orchestration
    - 3-stage execution: Intention → Delta → Order
    - Execution modes: Backtest (INSTANT/LATENT), Paper, Live
    - Built-in risk management and cost modeling

    ```python
    driver = TradingDriver.from_spec(spec)
    driver.load_data(items=["BTC/USDT:USDT"], start=..., end=...)
    for result in driver.run():
        print(f"PnL: {result.pnl}")
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Data Layer">
    **Multi-Asset Data Integration**

    - Crypto, stocks, macro, on-chain data sources
    - Environment-based automatic routing (dev/prod/kernel)
    - Validation, FFill, and live data handling
    - Redis integration for multi-consumer optimization

    ```python
    storage = get_storage("binance/futures/ohlcv")
    # Automatic routing based on environment
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Builders Develop Strategies">
    Builders create strategies using the ClyptQ Trading Engine's Operator Protocol and Strategy Framework. The same code runs from development through backtesting to live trading.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Transparent Verification">
    All strategy performance is verified through reproducible backtests and paper trading. The Trading Engine ensures identical execution between test and production environments.

    [Learn more about Trading System →](/engine/trading-system)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Marketplace Listing">
    Builders list verified strategies on the marketplace with transparent performance metrics. Buyers can evaluate strategies with complete confidence in the reported results.
