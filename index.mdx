## What Is ClyptQ?

ClyptQ is a **production-grade quantitative trading engine** where the same code runs identically in research, backtesting, and live trading. No rewrites. No adapters. No "production mode." Its architecture draws from the same fundamental principle that makes every computer work — the [separation of stateless computation from stateful memory](/getting-started/architecture-overview#the-architecture-behind-the-architecture) — applied to quantitative trading for the first time.

```python
# This SAME code runs in backtest, paper, and live
spec = TradingSpec(
    data=data_config,
    strategy=TradingStrategySpec(graph=graph),
    execution=TradingExecutionSpec(
        mode="backtest",    # ← Change to "paper" or "live"
        accounts=[account],
    ),
)

driver = TradingDriver.from_spec(spec)
for result in driver:
    print(f"{result.timestamp} | equity: {result.outputs['equity']}")
```
