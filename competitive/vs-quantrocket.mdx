## What Is QuantRocket?

QuantRocket is a **Docker-based quant trading platform** that bundles multiple backtesting engines, data services, and execution routing into a single orchestrated pipeline. It runs as a set of Docker microservices on your local machine or cloud VM.

Unlike most platforms that provide a single backtesting engine, QuantRocket offers **two**: Zipline (event-driven) and Moonshot (vectorized). It's primarily used for US equities and futures through Interactive Brokers.

## Architecture Comparison

### QuantRocket: Docker Microservices

QuantRocket runs as a collection of Docker containers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Docker Compose                │
│                                          │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌────────┐│
│  │ Jupyter   │  │ Zipline  │  │ IB     ││
│  │ Notebook  │  │ Engine   │  │Gateway ││
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └────────┘│
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌────────┐│
│  │ Moonshot  │  │ Database │  │ Flightlog│
│  │ Engine    │  │ (Postgres)│ │(Logging)││
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros**: Professional-grade pipeline, each service is isolated.
**Cons**: Requires Docker expertise, significant setup, self-hosted only.

### ClyptQ: Unified SaaS

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│           TradingSpec                 │
│  ┌──────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌────────┐│
│  │ Data │  │ Strategy │  │Execute ││
│  │ Spec │  │ (Graph)  │  │ Spec   ││
│  └──────┘  └──────────┘  └────────┘│
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
        │           │            │
   FIELD Protocol   DAG     Memoryless
                              Executor
```

Everything in one `TradingSpec`. No Docker. No microservices. No infrastructure management.

## The Two-Engine Problem

QuantRocket's two backtesting engines serve different purposes:

| Engine | Type | Best For | Live Trading |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Zipline** | Event-driven | Accurate simulation | Via adapter |
| **Moonshot** | Vectorized (pandas) | Fast parameter sweeps | Direct |

This creates a choice: **accuracy or speed**, but not both. And if you develop in Moonshot (fast), your strategy uses vectorized pandas code — which has [all the structural flaws of vectorized backtesting](/competitive/vs-vectorized).

**ClyptQ has one engine** — tick-by-tick, event-driven, with the same code path for backtest and live. No choosing between accuracy and convenience.

## Key Differences

### 1. Setup and Deployment

| | QuantRocket | ClyptQ |
|---|---|---|
| **Installation** | Docker Compose (~10 containers) | Open Jupyter notebook |
| **Setup time** | Hours (Docker, IB Gateway, data collection) | Minutes |
| **Infrastructure** | Self-managed (local or cloud VM) | Managed SaaS |
| **Updates** | Manual Docker image pulls | Automatic |
| **Monitoring** | Self-managed (Flightlog) | Built-in |

QuantRocket requires Docker familiarity and system administration. ClyptQ requires opening a browser.

### 2. Asset Class Focus

| | QuantRocket | ClyptQ |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary focus** | US equities, futures (via IB) | Crypto (5 exchanges) |
| **Crypto support** | Limited (through IB crypto or manual) | Native (Binance, Gate.io, Bybit, OKX, Coinbase) |
| **Futures modeling** | Basic (no funding rate, no liquidation) | Full (funding, margin, liquidation) |
| **Data** | IB data + third-party (Sharadar, EDI) | Included (exchange-quality OHLCV) |
| **Multi-exchange** | Single broker (IB) | Native multi-exchange (FIELD protocol) |

QuantRocket is built around Interactive Brokers. If you trade crypto across multiple exchanges, it's not designed for that.

### 3. Backtesting Accuracy

| | QuantRocket (Moonshot) | QuantRocket (Zipline) | ClyptQ |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lookahead prevention** | Manual (pandas) | Structural | Structural |
| **State management** | DataFrame-based | Event-driven | STATE protocol |
| **Cost modeling** | IB commission schedule | IB commission schedule | Exchange-specific (auto-fetched) |
| **Funding rates** | Not modeled | Not modeled | 8-hour settlement simulation |
| **Liquidation** | Not modeled | Not modeled | Exchange-specific margin logic |

### 4. Research-to-Production Path

**QuantRocket (Moonshot path):**
```python
# Research: pandas DataFrame operations
def prices_to_signals(prices):
    sma = prices.loc["Close"].rolling(20).mean()
    signals = prices.loc["Close"] > sma
    return signals.astype(int)

# Live: same pandas code, but runs on live IB data
# ✓ Code parity within Moonshot
# ✗ But vectorized → all structural flaws apply
```

**QuantRocket (Zipline path):**
```python
# Research: Zipline algorithm
def initialize(context):
    context.asset = symbol('AAPL')

def handle_data(context, data):
    mavg = data.history(context.asset, 'price', 20, '1d').mean()
    # Different from notebook research code
```

**ClyptQ:**
```python
# Research = Backtest = Live: same graph
graph.add_node("sma", SMA(span=20),
    inputs=[Input("FIELD:binance:futures:ohlcv:close", "1m", lookback=20)])
# mode="backtest" → mode="live": done
```

QuantRocket's Moonshot achieves code parity but at the cost of vectorized backtesting accuracy. Zipline achieves accuracy but requires different code patterns from research notebooks.

ClyptQ achieves both — accurate event-driven backtesting with full code parity.

### 5. Strategy Architecture

| | QuantRocket | ClyptQ |
|---|---|---|
| **Strategy pattern** | Function/class returning pandas DataFrames | Composable operator DAG |
| **Composability** | Limited (monolithic functions) | High (independent operators) |
| **Operator library** | No pre-built operators (DIY with pandas/ta-lib) | 213+ pre-built operators |
| **AI operators** | None | LLMScorer, WebSearch, Sentiment |
| **Custom indicators** | pandas/ta-lib | BaseOperator inheritance |

### 6. Pricing and Access

| | QuantRocket | ClyptQ |
|---|---|---|
| **Model** | Subscription + self-hosted | SaaS subscription |
| **Free tier** | Limited trial | Available |
| **Data costs** | IB data fees + optional third-party | Included |
| **Infrastructure costs** | Your servers (local or cloud) | Included |
| **Marketplace** | None | Verified strategy marketplace |

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | ClyptQ | QuantRocket |
|---|---|---|
| **Code parity** | Structural (one codebase) | Partial (Moonshot only, vectorized) |
| **Backtesting model** | Tick-by-tick state machine | Zipline (event) or Moonshot (vectorized) |
| **Language** | Python (any library) | Python (pandas-centric) |
| **Data included** | Yes (5 crypto exchanges) | IB data (requires IB account) |
| **Asset classes** | Crypto (stocks planned) | US equities, futures, forex (via IB) |
| **Futures support** | Full (funding, margin, liquidation) | Basic (IB margin rules) |
| **Multi-exchange** | Native (FIELD protocol) | Single broker (IB) |
| **Deployment** | SaaS (managed) | Docker (self-hosted) |
| **Setup time** | Minutes | Hours |
| **Operator library** | 213+ pre-built | None (DIY) |
| **AI operators** | Yes | No |
| **Marketplace** | Verified strategies | None |
| **Scheduling** | Managed | Cron-based (self-managed) |
| **Open source** | No | No (commercial license) |
