### Qualifying Round (Backtest)

Participants submit strategies via the platform. All strategies undergo:
1. **Cross-exchange validation** — Same strategy tested on unseen exchange data
2. **Cost model verification** — Realistic fees, slippage, funding rates applied
3. **Lookahead bias check** — Structural verification via ClyptQ's RollingBuffer architecture

Only strategies that pass all validation gates advance.

### Semi-Finals (Paper Trading)

Qualifying strategies run in **paper trading mode** for a fixed period (e.g., 30 days):
- Real-time market data via WebSocket
- Simulated execution with realistic fills
- Same graph, same code — only the data source changes

### Finals (Live Trading)

Top performers receive small capital allocations for **live trading**:
- Real execution on supported exchanges
- Risk limits enforced by the platform
- Performance tracked in real-time on public leaderboard

## Scoring Methodology

Competitions score strategies on risk-adjusted metrics, not raw returns:

| Metric | Weight | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 30% | Risk-adjusted returns |
| **Max Drawdown** | 20% | Downside risk control |
| **Calmar Ratio** | 15% | Return per unit of drawdown |
| **Cross-Exchange Consistency** | 15% | Robustness across venues |
| **Scale Stability** | 10% | Performance at larger capital |
| **Turnover Efficiency** | 10% | Transaction cost awareness |

Raw returns without risk adjustment are explicitly penalized — this prevents strategies that simply take maximum leverage.

## Capital Allocation Pipeline

Top competition performers become eligible for the **Marketplace Capital Program**:

1. **Competition Winner** — Featured strategy listing on marketplace
2. **Consistent Top 10** — Capital allocation from platform or partner funds
3. **Multi-competition Winner** — Direct fund allocation opportunity

This creates a hedge fund talent pipeline through the platform.

## Anti-Gaming Measures

| Measure | What It Prevents |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Cross-exchange validation** | Overfitting to single-exchange patterns |
| **Randomized test periods** | Data-mining and curve-fitting |
| **Code parity enforcement** | Different backtest vs live logic |
| **Position limit constraints** | Excessive concentration risk |

## Revenue Model

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Entry fees** | Per-competition entry fee |
| **Sponsorships** | Exchange and data provider sponsorships |
| **AUM fees** | Management/performance fees on allocated capital |
| **Premium access** | Advanced analytics and custom competition creation |

## Timeline

Competitions launch in **Phase 4** of the roadmap, after:
- Strategy marketplace is established (Phase 1-2)
- Sufficient builder community exists
- Cross-exchange validation is battle-tested
