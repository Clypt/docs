## Vision

ClyptQ's Data Marketplace brings **third-party data** directly into the operator framework. Instead of writing custom data pipelines, builders access vendor data as standard `FIELD` inputs — the same way they access OHLCV data today.

Data is either **provided by ClyptQ** (pre-licensed and included in the platform) or **purchased by builders** through vendor licensing agreements brokered by ClyptQ.

## Licensing Model

### ClyptQ-Provided Data

Data that ClyptQ licenses in bulk and provides to all users:

| Category | Examples | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Crypto OHLCV** | Binance, Bybit, Gate.io, Coinbase, Kraken | Included (current) |
| **Crypto on-chain (basic)** | Exchange flows, TVL, network metrics | Included (planned) |
| **Economic calendar** | FOMC, CPI, NFP, GDP releases | Included (planned) |
| **Funding rates** | Perpetual contract funding rates | Included (planned) |

### Vendor-Licensed Data

Data accessed through ClyptQ's licensing partnerships with vendors:

```
Builder → ClyptQ → Vendor
         ↕ License Agreement ↕
     (usage-based or subscription)
```

**How it works:**
1. ClyptQ negotiates **redistribution licenses** with data vendors
2. Builders subscribe to datasets through the ClyptQ marketplace
3. Data is delivered as standard `FIELD` inputs — no custom integration
4. Billing is either **per-use** (API calls) or **monthly subscription**
5. Vendors receive revenue share based on usage

**Pricing tiers:**

| Tier | Data Access | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | Crypto OHLCV, basic on-chain, economic calendar | All users |
| **Pro** | News feeds, fundamental data, advanced on-chain | Individual builders |
| **Enterprise** | Bloomberg, Refinitiv, satellite, premium alternative | Institutional |

### Vendor Integration Requirements

For a vendor to be listed on the ClyptQ marketplace:

1. **API availability** — REST or WebSocket API with documented endpoints
2. **Historical data** — Minimum 1 year of backfillable history for backtesting
3. **Licensing terms** — Redistribution rights for ClyptQ platform usage
4. **Data format** — Convertible to TaggedArray (numeric values with symbol alignment)
5. **Update frequency** — Defined update schedule (real-time, hourly, daily)

```

## Platform Integration

### Data as FIELD

All marketplace data follows the same `FIELD` protocol:

```
FIELD:{vendor}:{domain}:{field_name}
```

Examples:
- `FIELD:glassnode:onchain:exchange_inflow`
- `FIELD:benzinga:news:sentiment`
- `FIELD:simfin:fundamentals:pe_ratio`
- `FIELD:fred:macro:fed_funds_rate`

### Observation Specs

Each data category gets its own `ObservationSpec`:

```python
data = TradingDataSpec(
    symbol_source_map=SymbolSourceMap({
        "binance:futures": ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"],
    }),
    observations=[
        OHLCVSpec(exchange="binance", market_type="futures", timeframe="1m"),
        # Marketplace data (planned)
        OnChainSpec(vendor="glassnode", metrics=["exchange_inflow", "sopr"]),
        NewsSpec(vendor="benzinga", fields=["sentiment", "volume"]),
        FundamentalSpec(vendor="simfin", fields=["pe_ratio", "revenue_growth"]),
    ],
)
```

### Backtest Compatibility

Marketplace data supports backtesting through historical backfill:

- **Daily resolution data** (fundamentals, macro): Full historical coverage
- **Hourly resolution data** (on-chain, news sentiment): 1-3 years historical
- **Real-time data** (news events, social): Paper/live mode only (ephemeral)

Data that cannot be reliably backfilled is marked **ephemeral** and follows the same pattern as [semantic operators](/operators/semantic).

## Revenue Model

```
Builder pays $X/month for dataset
    → ClyptQ takes Y% platform fee
    → Vendor receives (100-Y)% revenue share
```

| Role | Value |
|---|---|
| **Vendor** | Distribution channel + integration effort handled by ClyptQ |
| **Builder** | One-click data access as FIELD inputs. No custom pipelines |
| **ClyptQ** | Platform revenue + data moat + builder retention |
