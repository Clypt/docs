## Overview

Clypt's B2B offering provides **institutional-grade quantitative infrastructure** for hedge funds, prop trading firms, and fintech companies. Built on the same ClyptQ engine that powers the consumer platform, B2B solutions add enterprise features: dedicated databases, LLM-powered research automation, and white-label deployment.

## Products

### Quant DB

A purpose-built database optimized for quantitative research:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Time-series storage** | Columnar Parquet-based storage optimized for OHLCV and tick data |
| **Factor library** | Pre-computed factor exposures (momentum, value, volatility, etc.) |
| **Alternative data** | News, on-chain analytics, social sentiment, funding rates |
| **API access** | REST and Python SDK for direct integration |
| **Cross-asset** | Crypto, equities, prediction markets in unified schema |

```python
# Planned API (subject to change)
from clyptq.enterprise import QuantDB

db = QuantDB(api_key="...")
data = db.query(
    symbols=["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"],
    fields=["close", "volume", "funding_rate"],
    start="2024-01-01",
    end="2024-12-31",
    timeframe="1h",
)
```

### LLM Agent Teams

Autonomous LLM-powered agent teams that accelerate the quant development lifecycle:

| Agent | Role | What It Does |

These agents collaborate in a pipeline:

```
Research → Builder → Backtest → Risk Review → Optimization → Deploy
```
