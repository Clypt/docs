description: "Expanding Clypt into prediction market trading and strategy development"
---

## Overview

Clypt will expand into **prediction markets**, enabling users to build and deploy quantitative strategies that trade on event outcomes. The same StatefulGraph architecture and operator protocol that powers crypto trading will extend to event-based contracts.

## Why Prediction Markets

Prediction markets are growing rapidly as a new asset class:

- **Polymarket** processed $1B+ in volume in 2024
- Event contracts offer uncorrelated returns to traditional crypto/equity markets
- The market structure (binary/scalar outcomes, fixed expiry) creates unique alpha opportunities
- Most prediction market trading is currently manual — quantitative automation is the next frontier

## Platform Integration

### Data Integration

New `ObservationSpec` types for prediction market data:

```python
# Planned API (subject to change)
from clyptq.apps.trading.spec.observation.prediction import PredictionSpec

prediction_data = PredictionSpec(
    platform="polymarket",
    categories=["politics", "crypto", "sports"],
    timeframe="1m",
)
```

### New Operators

Prediction market-specific operators planned:

| Operator | Category | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **ProbabilityCalibrator** | Transform | Calibrate implied probabilities from market prices |
| **EventResolver** | Signal | Track event resolution and settlement |
| **ExpiryDecay** | Signal | Time decay signal as event approaches resolution |
| **CrossMarketArb** | Alpha | Arbitrage between prediction market platforms |
| **SentimentCorrelation** | Semantic | Correlate news sentiment with contract prices |
| **MarketMaker** | Order | Automated market making for prediction contracts |

### Execution

The existing `TradingDriver` and `TradingIntention` pipeline extends to prediction market execution:
- Binary contract buying/selling
- Limit order placement for market making
- Automated settlement and profit collection

## Key Challenges

| Challenge | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Low liquidity** | Market making operators, smart order routing |
| **Event resolution risk** | Resolution tracking, early exit logic |
| **Non-standard data** | Custom ObservationSpec with probability fields |
| **Platform API diversity** | Exchange-agnostic adapter layer (same as crypto) |

## Timeline

Prediction market integration is planned for **Phase 2-3**:

1. **Phase 2**: Polymarket data integration + basic event operators
2. **Phase 3**: Full strategy support, marketplace listing, additional platforms
