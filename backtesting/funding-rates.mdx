## What Are Funding Rates?

Perpetual futures contracts have no expiry date. To keep the futures price anchored to the spot price, exchanges charge or pay **funding rates** every 8 hours. Holders of the majority side pay the minority side:

- **Positive funding rate**: Longs pay shorts (futures trading above spot)
- **Negative funding rate**: Shorts pay longs (futures trading below spot)

Funding rates typically range from **-0.1% to +0.3%** per 8-hour period. Over time, this represents a significant cost — or income — that most backtesting frameworks ignore entirely.

## Why It Matters

A strategy that holds a long BTC position for 30 days during a high-funding period:

```
Position: Long 1 BTC at $50,000
Average funding rate: +0.05% per 8h (bullish market)
Settlements per day: 3 (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC)

Daily cost:  $50,000 × 0.0005 × 3 = $75/day
Monthly cost: $75 × 30 = $2,250

→ 4.5% of position value lost to funding alone
```

A backtest that ignores this reports **4.5% higher returns** than reality. For leveraged positions, the distortion is proportionally larger.

## How ClyptQ Simulates Funding

### Auto-Injection

When you create a `TradingSpec` with a futures account, ClyptQ **automatically injects** a `FundingRateSpec` for that venue. You don't need to configure anything:

```python
spec = TradingSpec(
    data=TradingDataSpec(
        symbols=["BTC", "ETH"],
        observations=[
            OHLCVSpec(exchange="binance", market_type="futures", timeframe="1m"),
            # FundingRateSpec is auto-injected — no manual configuration needed
        ],
    ),
    execution=TradingExecutionSpec(
        mode="backtest",
        accounts=[
            AccountSpec(exchange="binance", market_type="futures", initial_cash=10_000),
        ],
    ),
)
```

The auto-injection logic in `TradingDriver.from_spec()`:

1. Scans all `AccountSpec`s for futures accounts
2. Checks if the exchange supports historical funding rates
3. If no `FundingRateSpec` exists for that venue, injects one automatically
4. Logs: `"Auto-injecting FundingRateSpec for binance:futures"`

### Settlement Timing

Funding is applied at the standard 8-hour intervals:

```python
# Applied when timestamp matches:
hour in (0, 8, 16) and minute == 0 and second == 0
```

This matches the settlement schedule of Binance, Bybit, and Gateio. Kraken uses 4h intervals and Coinbase uses 1h intervals — see [Exchange Specifics](/backtesting/exchange-specifics) for details.

<Warning>
The current executor checks only the standard 8h settlement times (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC). For Kraken (4h intervals) and Coinbase (1h intervals), funding settlements at non-standard hours are not yet applied in backtest. This may result in understated funding costs for these venues. A per-exchange settlement schedule is planned.
</Warning>

### Payment Calculation

At each settlement, for every open position:

```
funding_payment = position_amount × current_price × funding_rate

where:
  position_amount = signed quantity (positive=long, negative=short)
  current_price = mark price at settlement time
  funding_rate = historical rate for that symbol at that settlement
```

The payment is **sign-aware**:

| Position | Funding Rate | Notional | Payment | Effect |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|--------|
| Long 1 BTC | +0.05% | +$50,000 | +$25 | **Pay** $25 (cash decreases) |
| Short 1 BTC | +0.05% | -$50,000 | -$25 | **Receive** $25 (cash increases) |
| Long 1 BTC | -0.03% | +$50,000 | -$15 | **Receive** $15 (cash increases) |
| Short 1 BTC | -0.03% | -$50,000 | +$15 | **Pay** $15 (cash decreases) |

### Cumulative Tracking

Total funding paid is tracked per account for post-backtest analysis:

```python
# After backtest
state = driver.trading_state
for venue, account in state.accounts.items():
    print(f"{venue}: funding_paid = ${account.funding_paid:.2f}")
# → binance:futures: funding_paid = $-1,247.50  (negative = net paid)
```

## Exchange Support

Not all exchanges provide full historical funding rate data:

| Exchange | Historical Funding | Auto-Inject | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Binance** | Full history | Yes | Standard 8h intervals |
| **Bybit** | Full history | Yes | Standard 8h intervals |
| **Gateio** | Full history | Yes | Standard 8h intervals |
| **Kraken** | Full history | Yes | 4h intervals (6× per day) — only 8h settlements applied in backtest |
| **Coinbase** | Limited (~42 days) | No | 1h intervals — live funding rate API unsupported (falls back to 0) |

For exchanges with `has_funding_rate=False`, ClyptQ logs an info message and skips auto-injection. The backtest will run without funding simulation for that venue.

<Warning>
**Coinbase**: Funding costs are not simulated in backtest (limited historical data, no live API). Live P&L will differ from backtest due to unmodeled funding payments.

**Kraken**: Historical funding data is available, but the executor only applies settlements at 8h boundaries. The three additional 4h settlements (04:00, 12:00, 20:00) are not yet applied, understating funding costs by approximately half.
</Warning>

## Missing Rate Handling

If funding rate data is missing for a symbol with an open position, ClyptQ logs a warning:

```
[FUNDING] Missing funding rates for binance:futures: ['DOGE/USDT'].
Backtest PnL may be inaccurate.
```

This can happen when:
- The symbol was recently listed (no historical funding data)
- Data collection has gaps
- The symbol uses a non-standard funding schedule

The position is **not affected** by the missing rate — it simply skips that settlement. This is conservative: in reality, funding would have been charged.

## Impact on Strategy Design

### High-Frequency Strategies

Strategies that open and close positions within a single 8-hour window are **unaffected** by funding — they never hold through a settlement. This is one reason why short-term momentum strategies often work better with perpetual futures than long-term holds.

### Funding Rate Arbitrage

Some strategies specifically target funding rate income:

```
Strategy: Short high-funding perpetual + Long spot (delta neutral)
Income: Collect positive funding rate without directional exposure
Risk: Basis change, execution costs, liquidation
```

ClyptQ's funding simulation makes these strategies backtestable with realistic P&L.

### Long-Hold Strategies

Strategies that hold positions for weeks or months must account for cumulative funding. A common pattern:

```python
# Add funding cost to exit decision
class FundingAwareExit(BaseOperator):
    def compute(self, inputs, timestamp, context):
        signal = inputs[0]
        # Consider closing long positions when funding is consistently high
        # The backtest automatically deducts funding from equity,
        # so Sharpe ratio and drawdown metrics reflect real costs
        ...
```
