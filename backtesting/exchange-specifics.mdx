## Overview

Each supported exchange has unique characteristics that ClyptQ models precisely. This page consolidates all exchange-specific parameters in one place.

## Supported Exchanges

### Market Type Support

| Exchange | Spot | Futures (Linear) | Max Leverage | Quote Currency | Funding Rates |
|----------|------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Binance** | Yes | Yes | 125× | USDT, USDC | Full history |

### Default Fee Rates (Non-VIP)

Fees are auto-fetched via CCXT. These are default tier rates — VIP rates are lower.

| Exchange | Spot Maker | Spot Taker | Futures Maker | Futures Taker |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Binance** | 0.10% | 0.10% | 0.02% | 0.04% |
| **Bybit** | 0.10% | 0.10% | 0.02% | 0.055% |
| **Gateio** | 0.20% | 0.20% | 0.015% | 0.05% |
| **Coinbase** | 0.40% | 0.60% | 0.02% | 0.06% |
| **Kraken** | 0.25% | 0.40% | 0.02% | 0.05% |

<Info>
VIP rates can be 2-10× lower than default rates. Use `CostModelSpec` to override with your actual tier. See [Cost Models](/backtesting/cost-models) for details.
</Info>

### Margin & Liquidation Parameters

| Exchange | Default MMR | Liquidation Fee | Threshold | Formula |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| **Binance** | 1.3% | 0.75% | 100% | Inverted (MMR/Equity × 100) |
| **Bybit** | 0.5% | 0.6% | 1.0 | Normal (Equity/MMR) |
| **Gateio** | 1.0% | 0.5% | 1.5 | Normal (more conservative) |
| **Coinbase** | 6.67% | 1.0% | 1.0 | Normal (CFTC regulated) |
| **Kraken** | 2.0% | 1.5% | 1.0 | Normal (regulated) |

See [Liquidation Logic](/backtesting/liquidation-logic) for detailed calculation examples.

## Per-Exchange Details

### Binance

The most liquid crypto exchange with the widest selection of perpetual futures.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Market types**: Spot, USDT-M Futures (linear), COIN-M Futures (inverse)
- **Quote currencies**: USDT (primary), USDC
- **Max leverage**: 125× (BTC/ETH), lower for altcoins
- **Tiered MMR**: Position size determines MMR tier (1.3% → 50% across tiers)
- **Insurance fund**: Largest in the industry

**Configuration example:**
```python
AccountSpec(
    exchange="binance",
    market_type="futures",
    base_currency="USDT",
    initial_cash=50_000.0,
    max_leverage=20.0,
    cost_model=CostModelSpec(
        maker_fee=0.0002,    # VIP 1
        taker_fee=0.0004,    # VIP 1
    ),
)
```

### Bybit

Known for derivatives trading with competitive fee structures.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Market types**: Spot, USDT Perpetual, Inverse Perpetual
- **Quote currencies**: USDT, USDC
- **Max leverage**: 100× (BTC/ETH)
- **Lower MMR**: 0.5% default (more aggressive than Binance)
- **Unified margin**: Cross-asset margin pool

**Configuration example:**
```python
AccountSpec(
    exchange="bybit",
    market_type="futures",
    base_currency="USDT",
    initial_cash=30_000.0,
    max_leverage=10.0,
    # No cost_model → auto-fetched from Bybit API
)
```

### Gateio

Broad altcoin selection with higher liquidation threshold.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Market types**: Spot, USDT Futures
- **Quote currencies**: USDT
- **Max leverage**: 100×
- **Higher threshold**: 1.5 margin ratio (more conservative than peers)
- **Altcoin depth**: More small-cap perpetuals than other exchanges
- **Contract units**: Futures use integer contracts, not fractional amounts

**Important note:** Gateio's 1.5× liquidation threshold means positions are liquidated **earlier** than on Binance or Bybit. A strategy that survives on Binance may get liquidated on Gateio with the same parameters.

**Contract unit conversion:** Gateio futures require integer contracts. The API converts between BTC amounts and contracts automatically:

```python
# Gate.io: precision.amount == 1.0 → integer contracts only
# Example: BTC/USDT contract_size = 0.0001 BTC
# 0.1 BTC order → 1000 contracts
contracts = amount / contract_size
# API receives contracts (integer), internally tracked in BTC
```

### Coinbase

US-regulated exchange with CFTC oversight and strict leverage limits.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Market types**: Spot, USDC Perpetual
- **Quote currencies**: USDC (only)
- **Max leverage**: 10× (CFTC limit)
- **High MMR**: 6.67% (MM = IM × ⅔) — always static default (no dynamic tier API)
- **Higher fees**: Liquidation fee at 1.0%
- **No funding simulation**: `has_funding_rate=False` — funding not auto-injected

<Warning>
Coinbase has `has_funding_rate=False`, so funding is **not simulated** in backtest or paper trading (rate defaults to 0). Historical funding data is limited to ~42 days and the live API is unsupported. Futures backtest P&L will not include funding costs. Consider using Binance or Bybit for accurate futures backtests.
</Warning>

### Kraken

Regulated exchange with moderate leverage and higher liquidation costs.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Market types**: Spot, USD Futures (via krakenfutures)
- **Quote currencies**: USD
- **Max leverage**: 50×
- **Higher MMR**: 2.0% default — dynamic tier resolution supported via CCXT public API
- **Higher liquidation fee**: 1.5%
- **4-hour funding**: 6 settlements per day (vs standard 3) — fully simulated at all 6 settlement times

<Note>
Kraken's 4-hour funding schedule means 6 settlements per day (00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC). The backtest executor applies funding at all 6 settlement boundaries using per-exchange `FUNDING_SETTLEMENT_HOURS`.

**CCXT note**: `fetch_funding_rate_history()` returns data at 1h intervals for Kraken, but the intermediate values (01h, 02h, 03h, etc.) are **predicted rates**, not actual settlements. Only the 4h boundary values represent real funding charges. The settlement hour gatekeeping ensures only real settlement times are applied.
</Note>

## Settlement Currencies

| Exchange | Spot | Futures |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Binance** | USDT (primary), FDUSD, USDC | USDT, USDC |
| **Bybit** | USDT, USDC | USDT |
| **Gateio** | USDT | USDT |
| **Coinbase** | USD, USDC | USDC |
| **Kraken** | USD, USDT | USD |

Symbol formats differ by exchange:

```
Spot:    BTC/USDT
Futures: BTC/USDT:USDT    (settlement currency suffix)
Kraken:  BTC/USD:USD
Coinbase: BTC/USDC:USDC
```

## Position Modes

| Exchange | One-Way | Hedge Mode | Notes |
|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Binance** | Yes | Yes | `position_side: "long"/"short"` |
| **Bybit** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Gateio** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Coinbase** | Yes | No | `position_side: "both"` only |
| **Kraken** | Yes | No | |

## Order Validation Limits

ClyptQ fetches minimum order sizes and lot sizes from each exchange via CCXT and enforces them during backtest:

### What Gets Validated

| Check | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Min amount** | Minimum order quantity | 0.001 BTC on Binance |
| **Min cost** | Minimum order notional value | $10 on Gateio |
| **Lot size** | Quantity precision/step size | 0.001 BTC step on Binance |
| **Price precision** | Tick size for limit orders | $0.10 for BTC on Binance |

### What Happens on Rejection

Orders that fail validation are **rejected** (not filled), matching live behavior:

```python
# After backtest, check rejection stats
results = driver.export_results()
rejection_stats = results.get("rejection_stats", {})
# → {"below_min_amount": 5, "below_min_cost": 3, "rounds_to_zero": 2}
```

If many orders are rejected, consider:
- Increasing book size (position sizing)
- Reducing the number of symbols (concentrated portfolio)
- Checking minimum requirements for your specific symbols

## Multi-Exchange Configuration

ClyptQ natively supports multi-exchange strategies. Each account has its own cost model, margin parameters, and order validation:

```python
spec = TradingSpec(
    data=TradingDataSpec(
        symbols=["BTC", "ETH", "SOL"],
        observations=[
            OHLCVSpec(exchange=["binance", "gateio"], market_type="futures", timeframe="1m"),
        ],
        symbol_source_map=SymbolSourceMap({
            "binance:futures": ["BTC", "ETH"],
            "gateio:futures": ["SOL"],
        }),
    ),
    execution=TradingExecutionSpec(
        accounts=[
            AccountSpec(exchange="binance", market_type="futures", base_currency="USDT", initial_cash=30_000),
            AccountSpec(exchange="gateio", market_type="futures", base_currency="USDT", initial_cash=20_000),
        ],
    ),
    mode="backtest",
)
```

Each venue is independently simulated:
- **Separate cost models** (Binance fees ≠ Gateio fees)
- **Separate liquidation** (Binance 100% threshold ≠ Gateio 150% threshold)
- **Separate funding** (each venue's historical rates)
- **Separate order validation** (each venue's minimum requirements)
