## Overview

Clypt operates as a **strategy development and marketplace platform**, not as a broker, exchange, or custodian. Users connect their own exchange accounts and execute trades through their own API keys. Clypt never holds, transfers, or custodies user funds.

This page outlines the general regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency trading across jurisdictions and the compliance responsibilities shared between the platform and its users.

## Platform Responsibility vs User Responsibility

| Area | Clypt's Role | User's Role |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Fund custody** | Never holds user funds | Maintains own exchange accounts |
| **API keys** | Zero storage — API keys are NOT retained in Clypt databases | Manages own API key permissions |
| **KYC/AML** | Does not perform KYC (not a financial intermediary) | Completes KYC on each exchange directly |
| **Trade execution** | Routes orders via user's exchange API | Responsible for complying with local laws |
| **Tax reporting** | Provides trade history export | Files own taxes per local requirements |
| **Exchange selection** | Lists supported exchanges | Ensures exchange is legal in their jurisdiction |

| **Basic** | Email, phone | Low withdrawal limits |
| **Intermediate** | Government ID, selfie | Standard trading limits |

### Clypt's KYC Approach

Clypt itself may implement user verification in the future for:

- **Competition participants** — Verification for competition prize eligibility
- **Enterprise clients** — Standard B2B onboarding

## Leverage and Margin Restrictions

| **Singapore** | No specific cap | MAS guidance applies |

Clypt's `AccountSpec` allows configuring leverage per account. Users are responsible for setting leverage within their jurisdiction's legal limits.

## Tax Considerations

Clypt provides tools to help with tax reporting but does not provide tax advice:

- **Trade history export** — CSV/JSON export of all backtest and live trades
- **P&L calculation** — Per-strategy and aggregate profit/loss tracking
- **Cost basis methods** — Support for FIFO, LIFO, and specific identification

Users should consult tax professionals for jurisdiction-specific guidance on:
- Capital gains treatment of crypto assets
- Reporting thresholds and requirements
- Cross-border tax implications
- Staking/funding rate income classification
