## Overview

This guide is for **strategy investors** — people who want to deploy verified strategies from the ClyptQ marketplace without writing code. It covers how to evaluate strategies, deploy them safely, and manage risk.

## Why ClyptQ for Buyers?

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|
| **Independent Verification** | All metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, returns) are computed by the platform — not self-reported by builders |
| **Cross-Exchange Validation** | Strategies are tested on exchange data the builder never saw. Overfitting is exposed |
| **Code Parity** | The strategy you paper-trade is the exact same code that was backtested. No "backtest version" vs "live version" |
| **One-Click Deploy** | Paper trade → live with a parameter change. Same graph, same logic |
| **Built-in Safety** | Emergency shutdown, balance sync, drawdown limits — all built into the engine |

## Strategy Evaluation

### What metrics to look for

Every marketplace strategy shows independently verified metrics. All core metrics are **annualized and standardized** for consistent comparison across strategies:

<Info>
**Required Metrics (Annualized):** Every listing must display **Annualized Total Return (CAGR)**, **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**, and **Annualized Sharpe Ratio** — all computed with `periods_per_year=252` by the platform.
</Info>

**Return Metrics:**

| Metric | What It Tells You | Standardization | Good Target |
|--------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Total Return (CAGR)** | Annualized compound growth rate | **Annualized** (`periods_per_year=252`) | > 30%/year |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Annualized return per unit of risk | **Annualized** (`periods_per_year=252`) | > 1.5 |
| **Sortino Ratio** | Annualized return per unit of downside risk | **Annualized** (downside deviation) | > 2.0 |

**Risk Metrics:**

| Metric | What It Tells You | Standardization | Good Target |
|--------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Max Drawdown (MDD)** | Worst peak-to-trough decline | **Peak-to-trough %** | < 20% |
| **Volatility** | Annualized standard deviation | **Annualized** (`periods_per_year=252`) | < 40% |
| **Win Rate** | % of profitable trades | Percentage | > 55% |
| **Profit Factor** | Total profit / Total loss | Ratio | > 1.5 |

**Trust Metrics (ClyptQ-Specific):**

| Metric | What It Tells You | Builder Can Manipulate? |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Cross-Exchange Consistency** | Performance stability across venues | No |
| **Fee Impact** | Return degradation with real costs | No |
| **Funding Cost** | Cumulative funding rate impact | No |
| **Scale Sensitivity** | Performance at 2×, 5×, 10× capital | No |

### Cross-exchange validation

The platform tests every strategy on exchanges the builder never saw, producing a **consistency score** that reveals how well the strategy generalizes across venues. Look for high consistency and minimal gap between primary and cross-exchange performance.

### Scale testing results

Every listing shows how the strategy performs at 2x, 5x, and 10x the builder's declared capital, along with an **estimated capacity** -- the maximum AUM where the strategy maintains acceptable performance. If you plan to deploy more than the declared capital, check these results carefully.

### Evaluation checklist

Before deploying any strategy:

- [ ] **Sharpe > 1.0** after all costs (fees + funding + slippage)
- [ ] **Max drawdown** within your risk tolerance
- [ ] **1+ year backtest** with different market conditions
- [ ] **2+ weeks paper trading** verification exists
- [ ] **Cross-exchange consistency** is reasonable
- [ ] **Fee impact** doesn't destroy most of the return
- [ ] **Platform Verified badge** present

## Deployment

After purchasing a strategy, you deploy it from the **dashboard** — not from notebook cells. Paper and live trading are managed entirely through the platform UI.

### Step 1: Paper Trading

Paper trading uses live data with simulated fills. No real money at risk. Start a paper run from the dashboard by selecting the purchased strategy and clicking **Paper Trade**.

**What happens:**
1. Historical warmup fills all operator buffers with past data
2. Clock syncs to the next real-time bar boundary
3. Live data arrives via WebSocket from the exchange
4. Orders are executed with simulated fills (same fill model as backtest)

**How long to paper trade:**

| Strategy Type | Recommended | Why |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Intraday | 1-2 weeks | Need enough trades for statistical significance |
| Daily | 2-4 weeks | Capture different market conditions |
| Swing | 4-8 weeks | Need multiple full trade cycles |

**What to verify:**
- Does paper equity roughly match backtest predictions for similar conditions?
- Are signals generating at expected frequency?
- Is latency acceptable for your timeframe?

### Step 2: Live (Small Capital)

If paper results match expectations, switch to live from the dashboard. Connect your exchange API credentials and allocate capital.

**Start small, scale gradually:**

| Phase | Capital | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Small** | 5-10% of target | 1-2 weeks | Verify real fills match paper |
| **Medium** | 25-50% of target | 2-4 weeks | Check for capacity constraints |
| **Full** | 100% | Ongoing | Monitor continuously |

At each phase, compare live performance to paper and backtest. Significant divergence indicates issues.

### Step 3: Monitoring

Track key metrics during live trading:

| Metric | Check Frequency | Action Threshold |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Equity** | Real-time | Unexpected drops > 5% |
| **Drawdown** | Real-time | Exceeds max drawdown target |
| **Sharpe (rolling)** | Daily | Drops below 0.5 |
| **Trade frequency** | Daily | Significant change from backtest |
| **Latency** | Daily | Processing exceeds clock interval |

## Safety Features

| Feature | What It Does | When It Activates |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Emergency shutdown** | Closes all positions immediately | Ctrl+C or SIGTERM signal |
| **Balance sync** | Detects external changes (manual trades, liquidation) | Before each tick |
| **Heartbeat** | Prevents Kernel idle timeout | Continuously during execution |
| **First tick skip** | Skips execution on first real-time tick | Transition from warmup to live |
| **Funding auto-injection** | Includes funding costs in simulation | Automatically for futures |

## Pricing

### Strategy Purchase

Strategies are purchased with a **one-time fee** set by the builder:

```
Strategy price:       Set by builder (e.g., $200)
Platform commission:  Platform takes a percentage of the sale
You pay:              The listed price — no recurring fees for the strategy itself
```

### Platform Subscription

Running strategies (paper or live) requires a **platform subscription**. Your subscription tier determines how many strategies you can run concurrently on the dashboard.

## Common Questions

**What if a strategy loses money?**
The strategy purchase is a one-time fee — there are no ongoing charges tied to performance. You can stop a strategy at any time via the dashboard — emergency shutdown closes all positions immediately.

**Can I modify a strategy?**
Buyers can adjust risk parameters (capital allocation, max leverage) but not strategy logic. The graph is the builder's intellectual property.

**Can I run multiple strategies?**
Yes. The number of strategies you can run concurrently depends on your platform subscription tier. Each strategy runs independently with its own account and risk parameters.

**What's the minimum investment?**
Varies by strategy. Typically $1,000-$10,000. The listing specifies minimum capital for the strategy to work effectively.

**How do I verify performance?**
All metrics are independently computed by the platform. You can also run your own backtest using the strategy's `TradingSpec` — results should match within tolerance.

**What if data disconnects?**
The driver automatically reconnects WebSocket feeds. If a gap is detected during reconnection, it fills from historical data (gap-fill warmup).

## Best Practices

### Due diligence
- Verify 1+ year backtest with real costs
- Check cross-exchange consistency (not just primary exchange results)
- Run paper trading yourself for 2+ weeks
- Understand the strategy's risk profile (leverage, max drawdown, asset classes)

### Position sizing
- Start with 5-10% of capital you're willing to risk
- Never allocate more than 20% to a single strategy
- Diversify across strategies with different alpha sources
- Account for correlation between strategies

### Risk management
- Set max drawdown limit before deploying
- Monitor daily — set up alerts for equity drops
- Have an emergency plan (know how to stop the driver)
- Re-evaluate quarterly: compare live vs backtest expectations
