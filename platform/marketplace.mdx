## Trading Commerce

The Clypt marketplace is not a typical app store. It's a **Trading Commerce** platform where backtests are independently verified, strategies are validated across exchanges the builder never had access to, and performance metrics are computed by the platform — not self-reported.

## How It Works

    end
    subgraph Trader
        F["Deploy: paper → live"]
    end
    A --> B
    E --> F
    class E highlight
    class F action
```

## Submission Flow

### What Builders Submit

Builders submit a **TradingSpec** — not source code. The TradingSpec defines the complete strategy (graph, operators, connections, parameters) in a serializable format:

```python
# Builder develops in Jupyter
spec = TradingSpec(
    data=data_config,
    strategy=TradingStrategySpec(graph=graph),
    execution=TradingExecutionSpec(accounts=[account]),
    mode="backtest",
)

# Submit to marketplace
# Platform receives the spec, not the .py files
```

**What is included**: Graph structure, operator types, parameters, input connections, execution configuration.

**What is NOT included**: Source code of custom operators (if any). Custom operators are packaged as compiled modules.

### Validation Steps

1. **Reproducibility check**: Platform runs the submitted spec on the builder's declared exchange data. Results must match the builder's reported metrics within tolerance.

2. **Cross-exchange validation**: Platform runs the same spec on data from **exchanges the builder didn't use**. This catches strategies that are overfit to a single venue's price feed.

3. **Cost model verification**: Platform applies exchange-specific fees, funding rates, and liquidation logic. Strategies that are only profitable without costs are flagged.

## Why Validation Matters: Builder → Platform → Trader Trust Chain

The validation pipeline exists because **the trader's capital is at stake**. Every validation step directly addresses a specific risk that the trader faces:

        direction TB
        P1["Reproduce backtest"]
        P2["Unseen exchanges"]
        P3["Real venue fees"]
    end

        Y1["Sharpe 1.98 ✓"]
        Y2["Consistency 0.85"]
        Y3["Fee impact -12%"]
    end
    B1 --> P1 --> Y1
    B2 --> P2 --> Y2
    B3 --> P3 --> Y3
    class P1,P2,P3 highlight
    class Y1,Y2,Y3 success
```

**Without this chain:** Traders would have to trust self-reported metrics — the same broken trust model that plagues every existing copy-trading platform.

**With this chain:** Every number the trader sees was computed by the platform, on data the builder didn't choose.

## Cross-Exchange Validation (Venue Sampling)

### Why it's necessary

A strategy that only works on Binance might be exploiting:
- **Venue-specific microstructure** — Binance's matching engine quirks, fee rebates, or liquidity patterns
- **Data artifacts** — Gaps, misquotes, or feed-specific anomalies in one exchange's data
- **Overfit to price feed** — The "alpha" is just noise that happened to be profitable on one venue's price history

Cross-exchange validation catches all three by running the **exact same graph** on data the builder never saw.

### How it works

Because all operators process `TaggedArray`s (not exchange-specific data), the same strategy runs on any exchange:

```
Builder submits: Tested on Binance futures

Platform runs validation across venue samples:
  ✓ Binance futures  → Sharpe 1.8, MDD -12%  (builder's data — reproduced)
  ✓ Bybit futures    → Sharpe 1.5, MDD -15%  (builder never saw this data)
  ✓ Gateio futures   → Sharpe 1.3, MDD -18%  (builder never saw this data)
  ✗ Coinbase futures → Sharpe 0.4, MDD -35%  (poor — flagged in listing)
```

### What it catches

| Problem | How Venue Validation Detects It | Impact on Trader |
|---------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Venue-specific overfitting** | Sharpe drops 50%+ on other venues | Trader avoids deploying on other exchanges |
| **Microstructure exploitation** | Works on Binance, fails on Bybit | Trader knows the alpha source is fragile |
| **Data artifact trading** | Profits only from one feed's anomalies | Trader avoids strategies that can't generalize |
| **Robust alpha** | Consistent Sharpe across 4+ venues | Trader has high confidence in deploying |

### What the trader sees

The marketplace listing displays:
- **Primary exchange** results (builder's declared venue)
- **Cross-exchange** results (independently validated on each sampled venue)
- **Consistency score** — how stable performance is across venues (0 = unstable, 1 = perfectly consistent)
- **Recommended venues** — which exchanges are suitable for deployment

## Trader Experience

### Strategy Evaluation

Traders see independently verified metrics for each strategy:

| Metric | Source | Standardization | Builder Can Manipulate? |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Platform-computed | **Annualized** (`periods_per_year=252`) | No |
| **Max Drawdown (MDD)** | Platform-computed | **Peak-to-trough**, percentage | No |
| **Total Return** | Platform-computed | **Annualized** (CAGR) | No |
| Win Rate | Platform-computed | Percentage of positive returns | No |
| Volatility | Platform-computed | **Annualized** std deviation | No |
| Avg Trade Duration | Platform-computed | Time-weighted | No |
| Fee Impact | Platform-computed (real exchange fees) | Basis points | No |
| Funding Cost | Platform-computed (historical rates) | Annualized drag | No |
| Cross-Exchange Consistency | Platform-computed (unseen data) | 0-1 score | No |

<Info>
**All core metrics are annualized and standardized.** Sharpe Ratio, Total Return (CAGR), and Volatility use `periods_per_year=252` for consistent comparison across strategies with different timeframes. MDD is reported as the maximum peak-to-trough drawdown percentage. These three — **Annualized Return, MDD, and Annualized Sharpe** — are the required metrics for every marketplace listing.
</Info>

### Deployment

Traders deploy strategies from the dashboard:

1. **Paper trading** — Strategy runs on live data with simulated fills.
2. **Live trading** — Trader allocates capital. Strategy trades real money.

The trader's `TradingSpec` uses the same graph as the builder's — ensuring verified performance matches deployed performance.

## Revenue Model

The platform generates revenue from two primary streams:

### 1. Platform Subscription

Builders and traders pay a monthly subscription for access to infrastructure. The subscription tier determines the number of strategies you can run concurrently on the dashboard:

| Plan | Price | Live Trading Bots | LLM Credits | Backtest Data |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Starter** | Free | 1 | 5 / month | Limited |
| **Pro** | $30/month | 1 | 85 / month | Broad + Early Access Beta Data (on-chain, news, etc.) |
| **Premium** | $200/month | 5 | 730 / month | Full Data Access |

### 2. Marketplace Transaction Fee

Strategies are sold as **one-time purchases**. The platform takes a commission on each sale:

```
Trader pays one-time price → Platform takes commission → Builder receives remainder
```

The builder sets the strategy price (minimum $10). The platform commission varies by seller tier:

| Seller Tier | Builder Revenue Share | Platform Commission |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Free** | 80% | 20% |
| **Bronze** | 80% | 20% |
| **Silver** | 90% | 10% |
| **Gold** | 97.5% | 2.5% |

## Builder Monetization

Builders earn revenue without revealing their strategy logic:

- **Source code is never shared** — traders receive a deployed strategy, not source files
- **Cross-exchange validation proves** the strategy works without revealing how
- **Performance metrics are independently computed** — no self-reporting
- **Multiple traders can deploy** the same strategy simultaneously

## Trust Guarantees

| Guarantee | How It's Enforced |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Backtest accuracy** | Platform runs backtests with exchange-specific costs, funding, and liquidation |
| **No lookahead** | ClyptQ's RollingBuffer architecture makes it structurally impossible |
| **Independent metrics** | Platform computes all metrics — builders cannot override |
| **Cross-venue robustness** | Validated on data the builder never saw |
| **Real-time verification** | Paper trading results are tracked and compared to backtest expectations |
| **Malicious code protection** | Multi-layer validation pipeline detects and blocks abusive patterns before and during execution |
| **Metric integrity** | Required metric operators (AccumSharpe, AccumMaxDrawdown, AccumTotalReturn) are computed by platform code — cannot be faked |
