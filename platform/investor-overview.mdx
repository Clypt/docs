## Executive Summary

Clypt is a **Trading Commerce platform** that connects quantitative strategy builders with capital providers through independently verified, cross-exchange validated strategies. The platform's technical moat — code parity, structural lookahead prevention, and exchange-agnostic operators — creates defensible advantages that cannot be replicated by existing competitors without architectural rebuilds.

## The Market Opportunity

### Problem

Quantitative trading strategies fail in production because research code and live code are fundamentally different. This problem has been solved by hedge funds with multi-million-dollar infrastructure — but not by individual traders or small funds.

Existing solutions fall short in various ways — fragmented toolchains, separate research and production codebases, self-reported metrics, and limited marketplace verification.

## Technical Moat

### 1. Code Parity (Architectural)

The same `StatefulGraph` runs identically in backtest, paper, and live modes. This is not a feature — it's an architectural decision that permeates the entire system:

- **TradingSpec** declares the complete strategy as a serializable configuration
- **TradingDriver** executes the spec through an identical tick loop in all modes
- Only the data source (Parquet vs WebSocket) and fill engine (simulated vs real) change

**Why competitors can't replicate**: Achieving code parity requires the engine to be designed for it from the ground up. Bolting it onto an existing research platform or backtesting framework requires a complete rewrite.

### 2. Structural Lookahead Prevention

ClyptQ uses `RollingBuffer` — a pre-allocated circular buffer — that only exposes the declared lookback window to each operator. Combined with explicit `Input` declarations and automatic warmup computation, lookahead bias is **architecturally impossible**.

**Why this matters**: Vectorized backtests (pandas-based) can accidentally access future data. ClyptQ's approach eliminates this entire class of bugs at the framework level.

### 3. Exchange-Agnostic Operators

All operators process `TaggedArray` — a 4-field data structure (value, exists, valid, updated) that is independent of any exchange's data format. This enables:
- **Cross-exchange validation**: The same strategy runs on any exchange's data
- **Marketplace trust**: Strategies are verified on data the builder never saw
- **Multi-exchange strategies**: A single graph can trade across multiple venues

### 4. Operator Library

The prebuilt operator library covers:
- **Technical indicators** (SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, ATR, etc.)
- **Alpha signals**, factor models, and Alpha-101
- **Portfolio optimization** (MVO, RiskParity, EqualWeight)
- **Semantic operators** (LLM scoring, web search)
- **Universe filters** and liquidity scores

Each operator follows the same `BaseOperator.compute()` protocol, making them composable and interchangeable.

## Revenue Model

Two primary revenue streams drive the business:

### 1. Platform Subscription (Recurring)

Tiered monthly subscriptions for access to infrastructure:

| Plan | Price | Live Trading Bots | LLM Credits | Backtest Data |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Starter** | Free | 1 | 5 / month | Limited |
| **Pro** | $30/month | 1 | 85 / month | Broad + Early Access Beta Data (on-chain, news, etc.) |
| **Premium** | $200/month | 5 | 730 / month | Full Data Access |

Subscriptions provide **predictable, recurring revenue** regardless of market conditions.

### 2. Marketplace Transaction Fee (Transaction-based)

Strategies are sold as **one-time purchases**. The platform takes a commission on each sale:

```
Trader pays one-time price → Platform takes commission → Builder receives remainder
```

The builder sets the strategy price (minimum $10). The platform commission varies by seller tier (20% at Free/Bronze, 10% at Silver, 2.5% at Gold).

Transaction fees scale with **marketplace volume** — more traders purchasing more strategies = more revenue.

### Future Revenue Streams

| Stream | Model | Timeline |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Data marketplace** | Transaction-based | Phase 3 |
| **Enterprise licensing** | Annual contract | Phase 4 |
| **Competition fees** | Entry fees + sponsorships | Phase 4 |

## Growth Strategy

The marketplace creates a two-sided network: more builders attract more traders, and more traders attract more builders — driving revenue growth for both sides.

## Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Active builders** | Strategy creators developing on platform | Supply side of marketplace |
| **Listed strategies** | Verified strategies available for deployment | Marketplace depth |
| **AUM deployed** | Capital running on live strategies | Revenue proxy |
| **Cross-exchange pass rate** | % of strategies that pass cross-venue validation | Platform quality signal |
| **Backtest-to-live ratio** | Paper performance vs live performance correlation | Trust metric |
| **Builder revenue** | Total payouts to strategy creators | Supply-side retention |
